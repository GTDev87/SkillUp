- Need to fix javascript autocomplete duplicate code autocomplete_field_1 and 2

- Also need to fix duplicate code in lib/validators

- Upate tests for aggregation of points under describe with a before(:each)

- Rename sub_embeddings to sub_mission_embeddings

- Rename sub_embeddings to sub_skill_embeddings

- need tests for authentication

- need to add tests around form builder

- Need a ton of acceptance tests

- Rethink Points System (thoughts):
  - For Skill 1-10 star that correspond to points
  - Do average over time (month) to determine user rating for self
  - Record aggregate skill points
  - Keep missions at star levels to indicate difficulty between points range
  - Calculate skills at all levels by:
    - calculating all associations until lowest level.
    - then only keep lowest level and calculate points backwards
    - maybe only keep higher skills as suggestions and suggested potential
    
- refactor ratings for other users code needs a good refactoring

- the labeled form builder and presenters need A TON of tests

- want to refactor ajax code SERIOUSLY
